autograde
=========

A grading program written in golang to run intro level Java labs and produce a grade report. 

#warning
This program is in beta and is just really messing around with golang.  
It follows undocumented conventions and has no sample labs.
It needs a lot of work and only runs on mac and requires textmate to be installed.
